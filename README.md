Minimal model used to describe collective behaviour like flocks of birds

The flock which starts off with random velocities, change their direction with respect to their neighbours. This results in a global polarisation order that can be characterised using the normalised velocities as the order parameter.
The system shows a phase transition between disordered motion and collective motion (flocking transition) with respect to the noise and the density parameters
The Jupyter notebooks contain the implementation as well as a description of the mathematical model.
